# MOMD
My Own Markdown.

## Goal of project
The goal of the project is to tweak markdown in a way that makes it easier to use it for notetaking purposes.
Essentially I aim for a simple user process (for myself and others who might use this):

1. Get ida/thought.
2. Capture it *quickly* in *.md tweaked file.
3. Use MOMD-software to *store* it in a database and *publish* in relevant domains.
